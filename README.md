# Quantum Decks

## About this project
A #globalgamejam2021 project created in 48 hours.

In Quantum Decks, you take on the role of two enigmatic spacefarers battling a threat to the entire universe. They must use their amazing quantum-powers to defeat iconic encounters such as The Enterspice or Sentient Meteors.

Only teamwork and careful coordination will help them along the way. Play alone or with a friend over network!

With 51 unique hand-painted cards and 16 abilities to learn and master, there is a lot of replay value
